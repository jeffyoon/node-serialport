Imagine a world where you can write JavaScript to control blenders, lights, security systems, or even robots. Yes, I said robots. That world is here and now with node serialport. It provides a very simple interface to the low level serial port code necessary to program [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) chipsets, [X10](http://www.smarthome.com/manuals/protocol.txt) wireless communications, or even the rising [Z-Wave](http://www.z-wave.com/modules/ZwaveStart/) and [Zigbee](http://www.zigbee.org/) standards. The physical world is your oyster with this goodie. For a full break down of why we made this, please read [NodeBots - The Rise of JS Robotics](http://www.voodootikigod.com/nodebots-the-rise-of-js-robotics).

## Platform Support
`serialport` supports and tests against the following platforms, architectures and node versions.

| Platform / Arch | Node v0.10.x | Node v0.12.x | Node v4.x | Node v6.x |
|       ---       | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux / ia32    |  ☑  |  ☑  |  ☑  |  ☑  |
| Linux / x64     |  ☑  |  ☑  |  ☑  |  ☑  |
| Linux / ARM v6¹ |  ☐  |  ☐  |  ☐  |  ☐  |
| Linux / ARM v7¹ |  ☐  |  ☐  |  ☐  |  ☐  |
| Linux / ARM v8¹ |  ☐  |  ☐  |  ☐  |  ☐  |
| Linux / MIPSel¹ |  ☐  |  ☐  |  ☐  |  ☐  |
| Linux / PPC64¹  |  ☐  |  ☐  |  ☐  |  ☐  |
| Windows² / x86  |  ☑  |  ☑  |  ☑  |  ☑  |
| Windows² / x64  |  ☑  |  ☑  |  ☑  |  ☑  |
| OSX³ / x64      |  ☑  |  ☑  |  ☑  |  ☑  |

¹ ARM, MIPSel and PPC64¹ platforms are known to work but are not currently part of our test or build matrix. [#846](https://github.com/EmergingTechnologyAdvisors/node-serialport/issues/846) ARM v4 and v5 was dropped from NodeJS after Node v0.10.

² Windows 7, 8, 10, and 10 IoT are supported but only Windows Server 2012 R2 is tested by our CI.

³ OSX 10.4 Tiger and above are supported but only 10.9.5 Mavericks with Xcode 6.1 is tested in our CI.

## Installation Instructions

For most "standard" use cases (node v4.x on mac, linux, windows on a x86 or x64 processor), node-serialport will install nice and easy with a simple

```
npm install serialport
```

### Installation Special Cases

We are using [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp) to compile and post binaries of the library for most common use cases (linux, mac, windows on standard processor platforms). If you are on a special case, node-serialport will work, but it will compile the binary when you install.

This assumes you have everything on your system necessary to compile ANY native module for Node.js. This may not be the case, though, so please ensure the following are true for your system before filing an issue about "Does not install". For all operatings systems, please ensure you have Python 2.x installed AND not 3.0, node-gyp (what we use to compile) requires Python 2.x.

#### Windows

 * Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10 are supported.
 * Might just download and install with no extra steps. If the downloaded binary fails you'll have to build it with the following steps.
 * Install [Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/2013-downloads#d-2013-express).
 * If you are hacking on an Arduino, be sure to install [the drivers](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/windows#toc4).
 * Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) matching the bitness (32 or 64) of your operating system.
 * Install [Python 2.7.6](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/) matching the bitness of your operating system.  For any questions, please refer to their [FAQ](http://docs.python.org/2/faq/windows.html). Default settings are perfect.
 * Open the 'Visual Studio Command Prompt' and add Python to the path.

#### Mac OS X

Ensure that you have at a minimum the xCode Command Line Tools installed appropriate for your system configuration. If you recently upgraded the OS, it probably removed your installation of Command Line Tools, please verify before submitting a ticket. To compile `node-serialport` with Node.js 4.x+, you will need to use g++ v4.8 or higher.

#### Ubuntu/Debian Linux

The best way to install any version of NodeJS is to use the [NodeSource Node.js Binary Distributions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#installation-instructions). Older versions of Ubuntu install nodejs with the wrong version and binary name. If you node binary is `nodejs` not `node` or if your node version is [`v0.10.29`](https://github.com/fivdi/onoff/wiki/Node.js-v0.10.29-and-native-addons-on-the-Raspberry-Pi) then you should follow these instructions.

The package `build-essential` is necessary to compile `serialport`. If there's a binary for your platform you won't need it. Keep rocking!


```
# Using Ubuntu and node 6
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Using Debian and node 6, as root
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs
```

#### Alpine Linux

[Alpine](http://www.alpinelinux.org/) is a (very) small distro, but it uses the musl standard library instead of glibc (that most other Linux distros use), so it requires compilation.

```
# If you don't have node/npm already, add that first
sudo apk add --no-cache nodejs

# Add the necessary build and runtime dependencies
sudo apk add --no-cache make gcc g++ python linux-headers udev

# Then we can install serialport, forcing it to compile
npm install serialport --build-from-source=serialport
```

#### Raspberry Pi Linux

Follow the instructions for [setting up a Raspberry pi for use with Johnny-Five and Raspi IO](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io/wiki/Getting-a-Raspberry-Pi-ready-for-NodeBots). These projects use Node Serialport under the hood.

| Revision       |      CPU              | Arm Version |
|   ----         |      ---              |     ---     |
| A, A+, B, B+   | 32-bit ARM1176JZF-S   |    ARMv6    |
| Compute Module | 32-bit ARM1176JZF-S   |    ARMv6    |
| Zero           | 32-bit ARM1176JZF-S   |    ARMv6    |
| B2             | 32-bit ARM Cortex-A7  |    ARMv7    |
| B3             | 32-bit ARM Cortex-A53 |    ARMv8    |


#### Illegal Instruction

The pre-compiled binaries assume a fully capable chip. The Galileo 2 for example lacks a few instruction sets from the `ia32` architecture. A few other platforms have similar issues. So if you get `Illegal Instruction` when trying to run serialport you'll need to rebuild the serialport binary by asking npm to rebuild it.

```bash
# Will ask npm to build serialport during install time
npm install serialport --build-from-source

# If you have a package that depends on serialport you can ask npm to rebuild it specifically.
npm rebuild serialport --build-from-source

# Or leave out the package name to rebuild everything.
npm rebuild --build-from-source
```

#### Electron

Electron is a framework for creating cross-platform desktop applications. Electron comes with it's own version of the Node.js runtime.

If you require `serialport` as a dependency for an Electron project you need to compile it for the version of Electron you're using in your project.

When you first install `serialport` it will compile against the version of Node.js on your machine, not against the Node.js runtime bundled with Electron.

To recompile `serialport` (or any native Node.js module) for Electron you can use `electron-rebuild`.

1. `npm install --save-dev electron-rebuild`
2. Delete existing Node.js binding `node_modules/serialport/build/Release/serialport.node`
3. Run `electron-rebuild`
  1. For Windows `.\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd`
  2. For Linux and macOS `./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild`

For more information on `electron-rebuild` visit the official [README](https://github.com/electron/electron-rebuild/blob/master/README.md).

## Usage

Opening a serial port:

```js
var SerialPort = require("serialport");
var port = new SerialPort("/dev/tty-usbserial1", {
  baudRate: 57600
});
```

When opening a serial port, you can specify (in this order).

1. Path to Serial Port - required.
1. Options - optional and described below.

### Opening a Port

Constructing a `SerialPort` object will open a port on `nextTick`. You can bind events while the port is opening but you must wait until it is open to `write()` to it. (Most port functions require an open port.) You can call code when a port is opened in three ways.

- The `open` event is always emitted when the port is opened
- The constructor's openCallback is passed to `.open()` when the `autoOpen` option hasn't been disabled, if you have disabled it the callback is ignored.
- The `.open()` function takes a callback that is called after the port is opened. This can be used if you disabled the `autoOpen` option or have previously closed an open port.


```js
var SerialPort = require('serialport');
var port = new SerialPort('/dev/tty-usbserial1');

port.on('open', function() {
  port.write('main screen turn on', function(err) {
    if (err) {
      return console.log('Error on write: ', err.message);
    }
    console.log('message written');
  });
});

// open errors will be emitted as an error event
port.on('error', function(err) {
  console.log('Error: ', err.message);
})
```

This could be moved to the constructor's callback.
```js
var SerialPort = require('serialport');
var port = new SerialPort('/dev/tty-usbserial1', function (err) {
  if (err) {
    return console.log('Error: ', err.message);
  }
  port.write('main screen turn on', function(err) {
    if (err) {
      return console.log('Error on write: ', err.message);
    }
    console.log('message written');
  });
});
```

When disabling the `autoOpen` option you'll need to open the port on your own.

```js
var SerialPort = require('serialport');
var port = new SerialPort('/dev/tty-usbserial1', { autoOpen: false });

port.open(function (err) {
  if (err) {
    return console.log('Error opening port: ', err.message);
  }

  // write errors will be emitted on the port since there is no callback to write
  port.write('main screen turn on');
});

// the open event will always be emitted
port.on('open', function() {
  // open logic
});
```

You can get updates of new data from the Serial Port as follows:

```js
port.on('data', function (data) {
  console.log('Data: ' + data);
});
```

You can write to the serial port by sending a string or buffer to the write method as follows:

```js
port.write('Hi Mom!');
port.write(new Buffer('Hi Mom!'));
```

Enjoy and do cool things with this code.

`serialport-list` will list all available serial ports in different formats.

```bash
$ serialport-list -h

  Usage: serialport-list [options]

  List available serial ports

  Options:

    -h, --help           output usage information
